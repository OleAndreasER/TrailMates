# TDT4140-project
My group of six's project for TDT4140 Software Engineering. It is a website for viewing and publishing trips.  
I worked mostly on the server and its responsibilities: storing and retrieving comments, likes/favorites, user information, and trips; as well as recommending trips for the user. The recommendation algorithm is easily configurable and extendable with more considerations (check out [config.ts](backend/src/resources/trips/recommended/config.ts)).  
Note that this backend is insecure. We were told that they would not take security into account at all when grading.
